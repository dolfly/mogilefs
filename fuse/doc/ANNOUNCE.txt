There's been some talk of MogileFS and FUSE recently, which allows you
to mount MogileFS under Linux (and other OSes) as a network share.

I've attached a Perl script which makes this work. If someone wants to
take this and run with it and add it to svn it'd be peachy.

Your MogileFS filenames should be of the format "/foo/bar/quux.gif"
for this to work sensibly.

I particularly proud of doing the range requests.

It's annoying that the tracker can't give you file sizes though.

The one big hack is to figure out directory paths - somewhat
inefficiently it needs to go through every path to see what
directories to show at the root mount point. It gets more efficient
lower down though.

Performance wise: it's not too bad, it's not too good. Don't throw
away Samba yet.

Many thanks to Foxtons Ltd. for letting me hack on this at work.

Leon
